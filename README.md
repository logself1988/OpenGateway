OpenGateway
====
**OpenGateway** is a open source gateway implementation powered with buildroot and mainline hardware platforms.

Guide
-----
There is a Makefile which is a wrapper of buildroot build system, so you can just make what you used to make as same as in buildroot. Although we choosed some popular opensource hardware platforms as examples, such as BeagleBone Black, Raspberry Pi, etc, but also support and welcome user defined hardwares joined this project. 

Anyway
-----
This is also a good example on how to using buildroot.
